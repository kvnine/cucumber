git clone https://helloapp/app.git
    To get the code to local machine. It would be refered as git local repo. By default, it will download the 'master'
    branch code
git clone -b dev https:https://helloapp/app.git
        To get the code to local machine. It would be referred as git local repo. It will download the dev branch
        code
Once code got download to local machine as git local repo we star working on the code.
and add the automation test to the code.

git checkout -b accounts
    It will create new local branch with name accounts

git checkout dev
    It will switch to dev branch from accounts.

git add .
    It would add all the modified/newlyAdded files to the stage area

git commit -m 'updated with automation code for create account functionality'
    It would commit all the above add changes to the stage area
git push origin accounts
    It would push all the local git repo branch code to git remote repo.

We will raise a pull request(PR) to initiate the merge from account branch to master branch.
Our colleague or team lead will approve the PR and then merge will be successful.
Now accounts branch code will be present in masters branch.
Later we can delete accounts branch too.

git pull origin master
    It would pull the latest code from git remote branch(master) to local git repo.
